# Bakery production simulation

## Description
This application illustrates the production of a medium-sized bakery. First of all, we need to set the products we want to produce. The program then assigns the workers to the production phases, and the simulation begins, during which we can see who works where, where the material was taken from, etc. During the entire duration of the simulation, you can click on a specific work position to find out who works there, and with the help of a QR code, you can also find out more information about the worker. At the end of the simulation, we have the option of saving the results of the simulation in a pdf file.
